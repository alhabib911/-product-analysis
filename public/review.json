Water proof ip68 , AMOLED screen everything is fine.But always on display only for 20 minutes and you you have set again after 20 minutes. battery life okay in idle mode. But if connect with phone than so much battery drain. Always measuring heart rate I don't like this. And when always one display on raise to wake up feature will off. I just want to wake up the display whenever I raise my hand while the always on displays on or off. Also just give option for making the heart rate sensor onoff  while screen is off. ",
